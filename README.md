# mongration [![build status](https://travis-ci.org/awapps/mongration.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/awapps/mongration) [![NPM version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/mongration.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/mongration)

> A node.js migration framework for MongoDB.

This is a javascript framework that connects to a mongoDB and run the migrations following the specified order.
It is very different from other migration projects because of: 
* **checksum** — issues an error whenever a change on an already migrated file was changed,
* **persists migration state** — all migrations are persisted on database,
* **migration order** — guarantees migration order
* **replica sets** — replica sets are fully suported,
* **rollback** — rollback process is automatically started whenever an error happens during a migration,
* **sync / async migrations** — developers can run multiple migrations in sync or async ways,
* **multiple databases migrations** — developers can run multiple databases migrations sync / asynchronously

## Programmatic Usage

It's a regular node module, just `npm install` and `require` it:


```bash
  npm install mongration --save
```

```javascript
var Migration = require('mongration').Migration;
```


### Configuration

The configuration object is a straightforward javascript object that contains the MongoDb access and the collection that will be used to save the migration state:

```javascript
module.exports = {
   hosts: 'my.host.com:27017',
   db: 'mydb',
   user : 'myuser',
   password : 'mypass',
   mongoUri : 'mongodb://myuser:mypass@my.host.com:27017/mydb',
   migrationCollection: 'migrationversion'
}
```

The **migrationCollection** configuration is **always required**. This is the collection name where the [migration state is persisted](#migration-state-persisted).

You can either specifiy connection parameters separately, or the entire **mongoUri** with all the connection parameters.
If you decide to go with the splitted params, **hosts** parameter is required. 

Please use **user** and **password** params only when authentication is required.


### Creating `Migration` object

Simply `require` mongration constructor and initialize it with your [configuration](#configuration):

```javascript
var mydbConfig = require('./config');

var Migration = require('mongration').Migration;
var mydbMigration = new Migration(mydbConfig);
```


### Creating migration steps

A migration step is a regular javascript object which has 3 properties: 
* `id` — Migration step ID **must be unique** (**required**): Will be used to save migration state on database
* `up` — Migration script itself (**required**): Uses MongoDB [native driver](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/) to run commands on database
* `down` — Rollback script itself (*optional*): Will be used to [Rollback](#rollback) changes in case migration has any error

```javascript
module.exports = {
    id: '1-step',

    up : function(db, cb){
        db.collection('testcollection').insert({ name: 'initial-setup' }, cb);
    },

    down : function(db, cb){
        db.collection('testcollection').remove({ name: 'initial-setup' }, cb);
    }
}
```

Both `up` and `down` receive two parameters: **db** (MongoDB connection) and **cb** (a callback function that will tell the framework that the step has been completed with / out errors).


### Adding steps to migration

`Migration` object exposes an `add` method which receives both single or bulk migration steps. You must provide the migration file path to this framework so it can read it and run [checksum](#checksum) security routine.

We suggest [nodejs path module](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html) to discover migration step absolute path:

```javascript
var path = require('path');

// adding bulk
mydbMigration.add([
    path.join(__dirname, './migrations-folder/1-step.js'),
    path.join(__dirname, './migrations-folder/2-step.js')
]);

// adding single
mydbMigration.add(path.join(__dirname, './migrations-folder/3-step.js'));
```


#### Multiple queries example

This framework supports multiple queries within the same migration step — developer just needs to handle local callbacks (between queries) and call framework back whenever the whole step is done.

We strongly suggest you to use [async module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async) to handle asynchronous javascript. Multiple queries example:

```javascript
var async = require('async');

module.exports = {
    id: 'my-migration-step-with-multiple-commands',
    
    up : function(db, cb){
        async.series(
            [
                function(_cb){db.collection('testcollection').insert({ name: 'initial-setup' }, _cb)},
                function(_cb){db.collection('othercollection').insert({ name: 'second-setup' }, _cb)},
                function(_cb){db.collection('othercollection').insert({ name: 'third-setup' }, _cb)}
            ],
            cb
        );  
    }
}
```


### Running migrations

After adding all steps to your migration, you simply need to run it like:

```javascript
mydbMigration.migrate(function(err, results){});
```

The `migrate` callback function receives 2 parameters:
* `err` — Error message (if the migration did not run properly)
* `results` — A list of status for each migration step. See more on [Migration outputs](#migration-outputs).

For a complete example, check [samples folder](samples/).


#### Migration outputs

All migration steps will have an output so developers know how *exactly* their migrations were performed.

##### Status ok
The migration step was **successfully performed** in the database. This step is saved in the database.

##### Status skipped
The migration step was skipped because **it was already performed** in a previous migration. This step was already saved in the database.

##### Status error
The migration **step returned an error** and the rollback process was called. The error details are returned on `migration.migrate()` callback as described in [Running migrations](#running-migrations). This step was not saved in the database.

##### Status rollback
Although the migration step was successfully performed, the [rollback](#rollback) process was called due to **an error in a step after this one**. This step is not saved in the database.

##### Status rollback-error
An error happened during migration process and **this step rollback process was not successfully completed**. The error details are returned on `migration.migrate()` callback as described in [Running migrations](#running-migrations). This step was not saved in the database - however database may contain unexpected data since rollback was not completely done.

##### Status not-run
The migration step **was not processed** because an error happened before getting into this step. This step is not saved in the database.


## Command line Usage

Read the [CLI tool docs](bin/README.md).


## Included features

This framework was built focused on solving real problems. For that, we have already included the features below.


### Checksum

Whenever a migration step is successfully performed, the step file **checksum** is saved on the database.
*Checksum* is the sum of all step file characters.

Example:
If migration step *1-changed-step-sample* was succesfully run, then a developer changes any part of it and try to run it again, the migration step will have **status : error ** and the exception below will be triggered:
```javascript
"[1-changed-step-sample] was already migrated in a different version. Current version[0685c17d538741a062c488ea776b0576] - Database version[72d9204bee94542118bd99cdde8edc0f]"
```

If there is no way to avoid changes in already executed step files, the *checksum* comparison can be disabled:
```javascript
mydbMigration.disableChecksumComparison();
```


### Migration Order

It makes sure that previsouly ran migrations will be rerun on the same order and, if developers changed the migration order, the migration step will have **status : error ** and the exception below will be triggered:
```javascript
"[1-step-sample] was already migrated on [Sat Dec 19 2015 10:18:27 GMT-0200 (BRST)] in a different order. Database order[1] - Current migration on this order[1-reordered-step-sample]"
```


### Migration state persisted

The migration state is saved on the **migrationCollection** defined on [configuration](#configuration):
```javascript
db.migrationversion.find()
{ "id" : "1-simple-query-sample", "checksum" : "a10e3030bb9683a971bae1f95b986033", order : "0", "date" : ISODate("2015-12-18T14:28:38.149Z") }
{ "id" : "2-multi-parallel-query", "checksum" : "3999fbcdf95d4c4a06e839cd0c66ede5", order : "1", "date" : ISODate("2015-12-18T14:28:38.187Z") }
{ "id" : "3-multi-sequential-query", "checksum" : "1181db9b787251df92fd9fb676da2d76", order : "2", "date" : ISODate("2015-12-18T14:28:38.287Z") }
```

The framework automatically saves the following data as migration state:
* `id` — ID defined on each migration step
* `checksum` — Checksum of migration step file that will be used to compare as part of future migrations
* `order` — Order the step was run
* `date` — When the migration step was processed


### Replica set support

As describred above, this framework supports migrations on both MongoDB standalone and replica sets versions. 
To connect to a replica set, enter your **replicaSet** name and add the replica set **hosts** on your [Configuration](#configuration):

```javascript
module.exports = {
    //...
    // with splitted params
    hosts: 'my.host.com:27017,my.otherhost.com:27018,my.backuphost.com:27019',
    replicaSet : 'myreplica',
   
    // or complete connection string
    mongoUri: 'mongodb://my.host.com:27017,my.otherhost.com:27018,my.backuphost.com:27019/mydb?replicaSet=myreplica'
}
```


### Rollback

Whenever an error happens during a migration step, the rollback process is automatically called.
The rollback process basically consists in calling `down` method of every step that was previously marked as **ok** or **error** - in other words: Skipped (previously ran steps) migration steps **are not rolled back**.

Please consider that steps without `down` methods will be automatically skipped when rollback process is called.
Please check [Migration outputs](#migration-outputs) to understand how rollback modifies steps' statuses.


### Sync and async migrations

Developers can run multiple queries (sync or async) as part of the same migration step.

#### Sync migration step
Please see below an example on how to run multiple **synchronous** queries as part of one migration step:
```javascript
var async = require('async');

module.exports = {
    id: 'sequential-query',

    up : function(db, cb){
        async.series(
            [
                function(cb){db.collection('testcollection').insert({ name: 'initial-sequential-setup' }, cb)},
                function(cb){db.collection('testcollection').insert({ name: 'second-sequential-setup' }, cb)},
                function(cb){db.collection('testcollection').insert({ name: 'third-sequential-setup' }, cb)}
            ],
            cb
        );
    }
}
```

#### Async migration step
Please see below an example on how to run multiple **asynchronous** queries as part of one migration step:
```javascript
var async = require('async');

module.exports = {
    id: 'parallel-query',

    up : function(db, cb){
        async.parallel(
            [
                function(cb){db.collection('testcollection').insert({ name: 'initial-parallel-setup' }, cb)},
                function(cb){db.collection('testcollection').insert({ name: 'second-parallel-setup' }, cb)},
                function(cb){db.collection('testcollection').insert({ name: 'third-parallel-setup' }, cb)}
            ],
            cb
        );
    }
}
```


### Multiple databases migrations

You have the ability to run migrations in more than one database at the same time. Please check the [Multi DB samples](samples/02-multi-db).
